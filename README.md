# travel_booking_app
The Travel Booking Application is a Django-based web app that enables users to register, log in, and manage profiles, browse travel options (Flights, Trains, Buses), book tickets, and manage or cancel bookings. Built with Django templates and SQLite, it ensures responsive design, user-friendly booking, and easy data management.
